``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")  
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and …columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are some
user/order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour.
There are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some
numeric codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

This data was collected over 5 weeks from a 63 year-old male diagnosed
with CHF. Variables in this dataset include week, weekday/end
(here,coded as weekday\_end), day (Sunday - Saturday), day of the month
(day\_id), and activity count. This dataset contains 50400 observations,
which were collected at each minute of the day, every day, for 5 weeks.

Fridays tend to be a high activity day, while weekends seem to have
lower activity. Saturdays especially have a lower activity count. Weeks
1, 2, and 5 seem to have a high activity count, with the exception of
Saturday in Week 5. Week 4 seems to have a lower relative activity count
as compared to other weeks of the same month. An activity count of 1440
is repeated twice - this number may have some significance.
